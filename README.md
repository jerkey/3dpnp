rotatorbracket.scad is for mounting a 6403R200 hollow-shaft motor on the right side of a 2014 type a machine http://typeamachines.com
the bracket fits on the bottom edge of the circuitboard using 18mm long screws to replace the original screws that held the board in place.
the Vcc Out connector can't be used as the connector is covering it up.  solder to the back of the board if you need Vcc out.

a 3.15mm tube is shoved through the motor and fits through the hole of the bracket, where a vacuum hose is attached.  A piece of heat shrink or two go around the lower end of the tube so that the vacuum pick and place needle can be shoved on and stays centered.
